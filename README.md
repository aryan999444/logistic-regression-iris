**A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating Logistic Regression for Iris flower classification.**

</div>

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Logistic Regression model to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.  The notebook utilizes the well-known Iris dataset, a classic example in machine learning.  It demonstrates the steps involved in building, training, and evaluating a simple yet effective classification model.  The target audience is anyone interested in learning about machine learning, specifically logistic regression, and its application to a real-world dataset.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**  Loads the Iris dataset and performs necessary preprocessing steps.
- **Model Training:** Trains a Logistic Regression model using the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Clear and Commented Code:** The Jupyter Notebook includes detailed explanations and comments for each step.
- **Visualizations:** (Potentially, depending on the notebook contents) Includes visualizations to aid in understanding the data and model performance.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  Scikit-learn (likely), Pandas (likely), Matplotlib or Seaborn (potentially for visualizations)


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (as listed in the notebook or installable via `pip install -r requirements.txt` if present)


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan999444/logistic-regression-iris.git
   cd logistic-regression-iris
   ```

2. **(If applicable) Install dependencies:**  Check the notebook for required libraries.  If a `requirements.txt` file exists, use:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LogisticRegression.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run the notebook:** Execute the cells sequentially in the Jupyter Notebook to see the Logistic Regression model in action.
